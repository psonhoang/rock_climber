*PS: 
- For the climb executable:

+ The first line will describe the initial position (LH, RH, LF, RF coordinates)
and the following lines will be the series of moves (e.g, LF 100 20) to reach to the last hold.

+ If the last hold is already reached in the initial position, the line after the first line
describing the initial position will simply say "Already reached last hold in initial position!"
